🔐 Google Drive Credentials (creds.json)
This app optionally supports syncing rate files from a specific Google Drive folder using the Google Drive API. To enable this feature, you'll need to create a Service Account and download a creds.json file.

📁 What creds.json Does:
Authenticates the app to read files from your Google Drive folder (read-only)

Must be placed in the root directory of the project

⚙️ How to Generate creds.json

Go to Google Cloud Console

https://console.cloud.google.com/

Create a new project or use an existing one

Enable the Google Drive API for that project

Go to APIs & Services → Credentials

Click “Create Credentials” → “Service Account”

After creating the account:

Go to the account settings

Under "Keys", create a new key → Choose JSON

This downloads your creds.json file

Rename it to just creds.json (if needed) and place it in your project root

🔗 Grant Drive Access
To let the service account access your Drive folder:

Share the target folder (in Google Drive) with the service account email address (looks like your-service-name@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com)

Give it Viewer access
